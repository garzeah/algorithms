# Time Complexity: Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles (if not duplicate) as
# we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of
# O(2^N) subsets, where â€˜Nâ€™ is the total number of elements in the input set. And
# since we construct a new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time
# complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*2^N).

# Space Complexity: All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list.
# Since, at most, we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, and each subset can take up to
# O(N) space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N).
